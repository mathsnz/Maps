# Maps
Created to support the geography / social science teachers at my school.

Maps are created using [QGIS](https://qgis.org/)

There are four versions of the maps:
Equal earth projection centered on Asia-Pacific ([EPSG 8859](https://epsg.io/8859))
- One with gridlines every 10 degrees
- One with no gridlines

Equal earth projection ([EPSG 8857](https://epsg.io/8857))
- One with gridlines every 10 degrees
- One with no gridlines
